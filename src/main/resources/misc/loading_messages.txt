Encrypting hard drive...
Locking up files...
Opening "homework" folder...
Migrating SSH keys...
Synthesizing engine fuel...
Emailing Linus Torvalds...
Brewing my 12th cup of RedBull...
Yelling at Cameron...
Hiding the evidence...
Starting a campfire...
Seducing my IDE...
Waking up Jake from a nap...
Ignoring compiler warnings...
Rolling out of bed...
Exiting vim...
